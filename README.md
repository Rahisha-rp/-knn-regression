The script outputs the following metrics:

Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.

R² Score: Indicates the proportion of variance in the target variable explained by the model.

Cross-Validation Scores: Provides the R² score for each fold during 5-fold cross-validation.


Example output:

MSE: 3038.86
R² Score: 0.43
Cross-Validation Scores: [0.31, 0.47, 0.39, 0.51, 0.42]
Average Accuracy: 0.42
